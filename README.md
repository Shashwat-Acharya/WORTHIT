# WORTHIT
This is going to be a auction Website so anyone intrested in this project can happly contribute

MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL:
THE BIDDER WHO HAS LOST THE BET BY BEING ON THE SECOND PLACE ALSO HAVE TO PAY THEIR BID (That's site earning. So, no Aruging about that). But if the owner cancels the auction then the second place bidder will also get 80% of their money back within 7 working days

BASIC STUFF:
1) Bid will be placed on anything available to Bid,but not less then the lower price which would had been set prior the auction
2) Bidder has to verify their profile before placing any bet (Still I don't know a damn thing about that now, But I have a way around I think)
3) The thing which is on auction will be peronally verified before putting on the site (Will explain this further in Verification Section)
4) Bids won't be accepted after the Close (I don't know if it make sense)
5) Money should be immediately be transfered after winning the bid otherwise their will be penalty according to the margin 

VERIFICATION STUFF:
1) Any one who want to place their thing for auction and it exceeds over $2700 then their should be 2 days prior request as we will personally verify the thing before putting it online anything below that price point can be put up their without a worry
2) Bidder Verification: The Bidder won the auction had to come and recieve the auctioned Item for him/herself and the person put the thing for the auction has to be their to give the item

NOW TRICKY PART (VERIFICATION CONTINUED):
1) Owner and the Bidder will be given a key pairs;
2) Penalty would be charged on the person who lost the key (Will Explain in Panelty Part)

DELIVERY:
1) If the bidder is ready to pick up the auctioned Item by himself then well and good, otherwise he had to pay the Delivery charges (accordingly)
2) Delivery will take it time according to the distance

PENALTY CRITERIA:
1) Losing of Key:
   a) If the price is below $2700:
   If its the Owner who lost the key then he/she has to give the item on 20% loss to the bidder
   Means if the Selling price is $100 then owner will receive only $80 but bidder has to pay the whole $100 to us
   If its the Bidder who lost the key and still want to buy the item he/she has to pay 10% extra to us
   If the bidder refuse to recieve the item then 60% of their money will be given back to them within 7 working days.
   b) If the price is above $2700:
   If the owner lost the key then he/she has to give the item on 10% loss to the bidder
   Means if the Selling price is $10000 then owner will receive only $8000 but bidder has to pay the whole $10000 to us
   If its the Bidder who lost the key and still want to buy the item he/she has to pay 10% extra to us and if the bidder refuse to recieve the item then 80% of their money will be given back to them within 7 working days.
2) Late submission of money:
   If the bidder who won the bid didn't pays the amount within next 2 hours of winning that bid then, their will be penalty of 10% of the price after every passing hour
3) Cancellation
   After winning the bid the bidder wish to cancel the winning then he/she pays 30% of the winning price rest 70% will be given back to them within 7 working days
   If the bidder cancel the winning upon delivery then they have to pay 40% of the winning rest 60% will be given back to them within 7 working days
   If the owner refuses to sell the object after the auction is done the the bidder's full money will be returned within 7 working days and the Owner will be charged 50% of the winning price
